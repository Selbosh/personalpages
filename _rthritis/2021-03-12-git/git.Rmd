This guide introduces the concept of version control using only GUI tools, namely
RStudio and the GitHub web interface.
If you'd prefer to learn command line syntax, there are many other resources available on the web from [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) and others.

## Using GitHub

### Create a GitHub repository

1.  Login or sign up for a free account at <https://www.github.com>.
2.  Click **New repository**, give it a name, e.g. `hello`, select
    “Public” and tick the box “Initialize this repository with a
    README”.
3.  Click **Create repository**.

### Learning to commit

Click on the file `README.md` and click the ✏️ pencil icon (“Edit this
file”) in the upper-right.

*If, in the previous step, you forgot to initialise with a README, you
can do it now by clicking on the link “We recommend every repository
include a README”.*

A basic text editor will appear, containing the contents of your
`README.md` file, which at the moment will be just:

``` markdown
# hello
```

Modify the file to say something like

``` markdown
# My first repository

Welcome to my GitHub repo! :smile:

Here I will *commit*, _pull_ and *push* plaintext documents and `code`.
```

This is a plain Markdown document. You can write in the same basic
syntax as for Markdown (`.md`) documents in RStudio (except mathematics
expressions, which are not supported).

Scroll down to where the page says **Commit changes**. In the first box,
add a short description of your changes to the file, e.g. “Add initial
fun facts”. Click the green **Commit changes** button. You will see a
rendering of your `README.md` Markdown file on your repository’s main
page.

### Adding files

As well as creating and editing pages in the browser, you can upload
files from your computer.

Let’s upload an image file. As this repository is displayed on the
public web, we should make sure we have permission to republish content.
Use [Creative Commons Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/) to
find a nice picture. Download it to your computer. I like [this
one](https://pixabay.com/en/chicks-spring-chicken-plumage-349035/).

![Picture of a chick, by Philipp Kleindienst](chick.jpg)

Check the licence; the picture above is
[CC0](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0) so I don’t actually
need to cite the author, but this isn’t always the case!

Open your GitHub repository page
(e.g. `https://github.com/username/hello`) in a web browser and upload
your image file, either using the **Upload files** button or by dragging
the file into your browser window. Write an informative commit message
like “Add nice picture of chick”, then **Commit changes**.

Edit your `README.md` file to include the image you just uploaded.
Before committing, use the “Preview changes” tab to check your Markdown
syntax is correct. Remember to cite the image source, if necessary, in a
caption or footnote. Commit your changes.

Made a mistake? Simply edit the file again and make another commit.

### Commit history

You should now have a GitHub repository with multiple commits and files
in it. Nostalgic for the old version? You can go back in time!

Visit the Commits page by clicking on the “\# commits” link on the
repository main page, or access the URL
`https://github.com/username/hello/commits/master`, replacing `username`
and `hello` with your username and repository name, respectively.

You should see a list of every commit made so far, from newest to
oldest.

-   The **&lt;&gt;** button on the right (“Browse the repository at this
    point in the history”) lets you look back on old versions of your
    project.
-   Clicking on the commit description or the hash (the 7 characters of
    gobbledegook) lets you review what changed between each commit, line
    by line. You can even leave comments!

If you fancy, ask your neighbour for their repository URL, visit one of
their commits and leave a comment on it, commending them on their image
choice, flair for Markdown syntax, etc. Mine’s here:
<https://github.com/Selbosh/hello>

## RStudio with Git

Editing documents online is handy, but probably not where you expect to
be doing most of your work. Now we will learn to connect RStudio with
GitHub.

### Version-controlled RStudio projects

In RStudio, go to *File &gt; New Project… &gt; Version Control &gt;
Git*.

Enter the URL of your GitHub repository into the “Repository URL” field,
for example `https://github.com/username/hello`, replacing `username`
with your GitHub user name and replacing `hello` with the name you gave
your new repository.

Choose somewhere to store the project on your computer, then click
**Create Project**. Enter your GitHub username and password, if
prompted.

RStudio will create a folder containing all your files so far, plus a
`hello.Rproj` file and a `.gitignore` file.

If you want to associate an existing RStudio Project with a GitHub
repository (rather than creating a new one), you can do so via *Tools
&gt; Version Control &gt; Project Setup…*.

### Pushing files

Let’s make some local changes and **push** them to GitHub.

In RStudio, open `README.md`. Modify some of the existing text if you
like, and add the following:

``` markdown
## A new section

I just wrote *this* in RStudio!
```

Visit the “Git” pane in RStudio and tick the “Staged” box next to
`README.md`, then **Commit**. You will see a summary of all the changes
you have made to the file.

Add a Commit message like “First edit from RStudio” and click
**Commit**.

Then click **Push**, enter your username and password again if prompted,
and your committed changes will be uploaded to GitHub.

### Pulling files

If you are working on multiple computers, or you have collaborators,
your local folder may not always be up to date with the latest version
of the repository that is on GitHub. In this case, we will want to
**Pull**.

In your web browser, edit `README.md` again. For example, add:

``` markdown
## Another new section created on GitHub

I will need to **pull** this!
```

and commit the changes.

Your local copy of the repository is now out of date! Let’s remedy this.
In RStudio, click **Pull**. Your files will magically update with the
latest changes.

### R Markdown GitHub documents

R Markdown supports a special format for previewing on the web. It
generates plain Markdown (`.md`) files and images suitable for display
on GitHub.

Rename or make a copy of your README called `README.Rmd`. Add this YAML
header.

``` yaml
---
output: github_document
---
```

Add an R chunk and some inline R code, for example:

``````markdown
## Evaluated R code

The `chickwts` dataset in R has ``r 'r nrow(chickwts)'`` rows.

```{r chickplot}`r ''`
plot(chickwts$weight ~ chickwts$feed,
     xlab = 'Feed type',
     ylab = 'Weight (grams)',
     col = 2:7)
```
``````

**Knit** the document and check the local preview looks OK. Notice that
`README.md` has now been updated with a plain Markdown version of your
generated document, and a folder called `README_files/` has been created
containing the rendered plot file(s).

Stage, commit and push all the new/modified files, which should be
something like the following.

-   `README.Rmd`
-   `README.md`
-   `README_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/chickplot-1.png`

Check the version on GitHub. Does everything look right?

## Forking and pull requests

Multiple people can collaborate in a single GitHub repository, all with
permission to commit, push and pull. This is something you can configure
in your repository settings, but not something we will try for the
moment.

Sometimes you may want to suggest changes to somebody else’s repository
without them giving you full access. This involves making a **Fork**
(your own personal copy) of the repository, making your suggested
changes, then filing a **Pull request**. If the owner of the original
repository approves, they will update the project with your changes.

You can do this if you want to correct a typographical error in a text
document, or if you reckon you can fix a bug in someone else’s code.

*You can do this task entirely in your web browser, or you can use
RStudio.*

1.  Visit <https://github.com/Selbosh/wdsi-lab> and click **Fork** (in
    the top-right corner). You now have your own “forked” version of my
    repository, which you can edit as you please.
2.  (*Optional.*) Create a new RStudio Project that checks out your Fork
    from GitHub. That is, go to *File &gt; New Project… &gt; Version
    Control &gt; Git* and enter the URL of your forked repository, which
    should be something like `https://github.com/your-username/wdsi-lab`
3.  If you performed Step 2, then open the file `README.md` in RStudio.
    Else, edit it in your web browser. Add your name and a link to your
    `hello` repository (the one you created in the previous section) to
    the Markdown table there.
4.  Commit & push your changes to your GitHub repository, then file a
    pull request. Assuming you didn’t break anything, I (David) will
    approve your pull request and your name will appear in the [**Hall
    of Fame**](https://github.com/Selbosh/wdsi-lab)!

Done? [File an issue](https://github.com/Selbosh/wdsi-lab/issues) with
any feedback you have about the course. Or, follow a link in the Hall of
Fame to somebody else’s repository and practise leaving comments and
filing pull requests.

## Blogging with R

I have written a blog post about [Getting started with
blogdown](http://selbydavid.com/wrugdown/2017/05/10/getting-started-with-blogdown/).
You can also view the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Selbosh/wrugdown) for that blog.

Or look at the source repository for a ‘real’ blog:
<https://github.com/Selbosh/selbosh.github.io>

Spotted a typo? Want to write a guest post? File a pull request!
